# rtl_multicore_task_scheduling
This project employs search algorithm principles to optimize scheduling tasks. This project is developed in Python and uses networkx library for generating random acyclic directed graphs, job profiles and platform models. The purpose of this project is to facilitate efficient resource allocation and optimization in high-load systems.
