# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

### Improving the Code

All users are encouraged to improve the code by finding and fixing bugs, optimizing performance, or adding new features. If you would like to contribute, feel free to fork the project, make your changes, and submit a pull request. 

### Dataset Generation

Our project includes a dataset generator which can be used to create datasets for research purposes. We encourage users to generate datasets and save them as pickle files in the dataset folder. This not only helps to test the robustness of our code but also provides valuable resources for the community.

### Discord Channel

For real-time discussions, we have a Discord server where users can discuss various aspects of the project, share their insights, or ask for help. Here is the Discord invite link: (https://discord.gg/S9xYegQw)

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [eng.sameralshaer@gmail.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html
