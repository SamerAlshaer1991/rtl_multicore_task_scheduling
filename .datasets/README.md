Optimized_scheduling_GA:The provided code implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) scheduler for task scheduling in a platform model. Here's a breakdown of the code's functionality:

Generation of Application and Platform Model:

A random acyclic Directed Graph is generated using the G(n,p) model (Barabási-Albert model) with a specified number of jobs (num_jobs) and probability (0.25).
The edge list is extracted from the graph.
Job attributes such as worst-case execution time (wcet) and message size (msg_sizes) are randomized.
Precedence relationships between jobs are established based on the generated graph.
The jobs and messages are represented using dictionaries (jobs and messages) to store their attributes.
The platform model is created with a specified number of processors (num_of_processors), routers (num_of_routers), and connections (Links). Routes between processors are determined using the Breadth-First Search algorithm and stored in the routes dictionary.
Function Definitions:

Several functions are defined, including utility functions for computing communication costs, extracting jobs with the highest priority, traffic control and collision avoidance, finding paths in the platform model, generating a chromosome (initial solution), calculating fitness function, generating a population, selection, mutation, and crossover.

Genetic Algorithm Implementation:

Genetic Algorithm Implementation:

Parameters for the GA scheduler are defined, such as population size (POPULATION_SIZE), elite size (ELITE_SIZE), mutation rate (mutation_rate), and maximum number of generations (MAX_GENERATIONS).
An initial population is generated using the generate_population function.
The GA scheduler is run for a fixed number of generations.
In each generation:
The fitness of each chromosome (individual) in the population is evaluated using the fitness_function.
The strongest gene (chromosome) in the population is stored as the best gene if its fitness value is higher than the previously stored maximum value.
Selection is performed to choose a portion of the population for producing offspring.
Mutation is applied to the selected individuals to create offspring.
The elite individuals (top performers) from the previous generation are added to the new population.
The new population is updated for the next generation.
The best fitness value and corresponding gene are tracked, and a break counter is implemented to speed up the operation.
The GA scheduler terminates if the break counter reaches 300 without finding a better solution.

Adjustable Parameters:
POPULATION_SIZE: The number of chromosomes (individuals) in the population.
ELITE_SIZE: The number of elite individuals (top performers) to be preserved in each generation.
mutation_rate: The probability of mutation for each gene (priority and processor) in a chromosome.
MAX_GENERATIONS: The maximum number of generations to run the GA scheduler.
An initial population is generated using the generate_population function.
The GA scheduler is run for a fixed number of generations.
In each generation:
The fitness of each chromosome (individual) in the population is evaluated using the fitness_function.
The strongest gene (chromosome) in the population is stored as the best gene if its fitness value is higher than the previously stored maximum value.

Overview:
The provided code is a scheduling algorithm implementation that aims to minimize the makespan of a set of jobs on a parallel computing platform. The code uses a brute-force approach to evaluate different combinations of job priorities and processor assignments. The scheduling algorithm considers the precedence constraints between jobs and the communication costs between processors.

Adjust the parameters:
Set the value of num_jobs to the desired number of jobs in the application.
Define the range of worst-case execution times (WCET) for the jobs using min_wcet and max_wcet.
Define the range of message sizes for communication between jobs using min_msg_sizes and max_msg_sizes.
Define the connections between processors in the Links list. Each tuple represents a connection between two processors.

Parallel Programming Explanation:
In order to speed up the evaluation of different combinations of job priorities and processor assignments, the code utilizes parallel programming. Here's how it works:

The number of threads to be used for parallel execution is specified using the num_threads variable. Adjust this value according to the available computational resources and desired level of parallelism.

A ThreadPoolExecutor is created from the concurrent.futures module, which manages the thread pool. The max_workers parameter is set to num_threads to determine the maximum number of threads to be used.

Combinations of priorities and processor assignments are generated using the itertools.permutations and itertools.product functions, respectively. priority_assignment represents the priorities of jobs, while processor_assignment represents the assignment of processors to jobs.

Tasks are submitted to the executor using the executor.submit method. Each combination of priorities and processor assignments corresponds to a task. The calculate_makespan function is executed in a separate thread, taking the combination and the jobs dictionary as input.

Each thread executes the calculate_makespan function with a specific combination of priorities and processor assignments. The function assigns the priorities and processors to the jobs, executes the scheduling algorithm, and calculates the makespan.

To prevent race conditions when updating the best_solution, a lock (lock) is used to ensure that only one thread can update it at a time.

Once all tasks have been submitted and executed, the best makespan and the corresponding solution are printed.

By utilizing parallel programming with multiple threads, the code evaluates different combinations simultaneously, reducing the execution time compared to a sequential approach. Each thread independently executes the scheduling algorithm for a specific combination of priorities and processor assignments. The use of a thread pool executor simplifies the management of threads and the parallel execution of tasks.

Note: While the provided code showcases parallel programming techniques, keep in mind that the efficiency gains from parallel execution depend on the available computational resources, the size of the problem, and the scheduling algorithm's characteristics. It's recommended to consider system limitations and perform performance testing to optimize the code for specific scenarios.
