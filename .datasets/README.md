Optimized_scheduling_GA:The provided code implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) scheduler for task scheduling in a platform model. Here's a breakdown of the code's functionality:

Generation of Application and Platform Model:

A random acyclic Directed Graph is generated using the G(n,p) model (Barabási-Albert model) with a specified number of jobs (num_jobs) and probability (0.25).
The edge list is extracted from the graph.
Job attributes such as worst-case execution time (wcet) and message size (msg_sizes) are randomized.
Precedence relationships between jobs are established based on the generated graph.
The jobs and messages are represented using dictionaries (jobs and messages) to store their attributes.
The platform model is created with a specified number of processors (num_of_processors), routers (num_of_routers), and connections (Links). Routes between processors are determined using the Breadth-First Search algorithm and stored in the routes dictionary.
Function Definitions:

Several functions are defined, including utility functions for computing communication costs, extracting jobs with the highest priority, traffic control and collision avoidance, finding paths in the platform model, generating a chromosome (initial solution), calculating fitness function, generating a population, selection, mutation, and crossover.

Generation of Application and Platform Model:

Adjustable Parameters:
num_jobs: The number of jobs in the application model. Determines the size of the directed graph.
The code generates a random acyclic Directed Graph using the G(n,p) model (Barabási-Albert model) with a specified number of jobs (num_jobs) and a probability of connection (0.25).
The edge list is extracted from the graph.
Job attributes such as worst-case execution time (wcet) and message size (msg_sizes) are randomized.
Precedence relationships between jobs are established based on the generated graph.
The jobs and messages are represented using dictionaries (jobs and messages) to store their attributes.
The platform model is created with adjustable parameters:
num_of_processors: The number of processors in the platform model.
num_of_routers: The number of routers in the platform model.
Links: The connections (links) between processors and routers in the platform model. This parameter should be manually defined based on the desired connectivity.
Function Definitions:

Several functions are defined to support the scheduling operation:
comm_cost: Calculates the communication cost (hops * message size) between two routers in a given route.
Extract_Highest_Priority: Retrieves the job with the highest priority from a list of ready jobs.
traffic_control_reserve: Performs traffic control and collision avoidance for reserving communication resources on the routes.
check_collision: Checks for collisions between communication resources and handles them.
find_path: Finds a route between two processors in the platform model using the Breadth-First Search algorithm.
generate_chromosome: Generates an initial chromosome (solution) by assigning priorities and processors to the jobs randomly.
fitness_function: Computes the fitness value (inverse of makespan) for a chromosome using the Schedule function.
generate_population: Generates an initial population of chromosomes with adjustable parameter POPULATION_SIZE.
selection: Performs selection to choose a portion of the population for producing offspring.
mutation: Applies mutation to a chromosome with a specified mutation rate.
crossover: Performs crossover (priority and processor swapping) between two parent chromosomes to create offspring.
dict_to_dataframe: Converts the chromosome dictionary into a Pandas DataFrame for visualization purposes.
Schedule: Implements the scheduling operation by allocating jobs to processors and calculating communication costs.
Genetic Algorithm Implementation:

Genetic Algorithm Implementation:

Parameters for the GA scheduler are defined, such as population size (POPULATION_SIZE), elite size (ELITE_SIZE), mutation rate (mutation_rate), and maximum number of generations (MAX_GENERATIONS).
An initial population is generated using the generate_population function.
The GA scheduler is run for a fixed number of generations.
In each generation:
The fitness of each chromosome (individual) in the population is evaluated using the fitness_function.
The strongest gene (chromosome) in the population is stored as the best gene if its fitness value is higher than the previously stored maximum value.
Selection is performed to choose a portion of the population for producing offspring.
Mutation is applied to the selected individuals to create offspring.
The elite individuals (top performers) from the previous generation are added to the new population.
The new population is updated for the next generation.
The best fitness value and corresponding gene are tracked, and a break counter is implemented to speed up the operation.
The GA scheduler terminates if the break counter reaches 300 without finding a better solution.

Adjustable Parameters:
POPULATION_SIZE: The number of chromosomes (individuals) in the population.
ELITE_SIZE: The number of elite individuals (top performers) to be preserved in each generation.
mutation_rate: The probability of mutation for each gene (priority and processor) in a chromosome.
MAX_GENERATIONS: The maximum number of generations to run the GA scheduler.
An initial population is generated using the generate_population function.
The GA scheduler is run for a fixed number of generations.
In each generation:
The fitness of each chromosome (individual) in the population is evaluated using the fitness_function.
The strongest gene (chromosome) in the population is stored as the best gene if its fitness value is higher than the previously stored maximum value.
Selection is performed to choose a portion of the population for producing offspring.
Mutation is applied to the selected individuals to create offspring.
The elite individuals (top performers)


Results:

The best gene (chromosome) and its fitness value are printed at the end of the GA scheduler.
